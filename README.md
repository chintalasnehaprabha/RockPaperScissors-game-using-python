This mini game is designed who don't have anyone to play , But here we have a friend named computer . The program requires some simple functions ,let me give some overview .

Random Function: It generates Rock,Paper and Scissors.

Valid Function: To check the validity of move.

Result Function: To declare the Winner of the round.

ScoreKeeper: To keep track of the score.

The program requires the user to make the first move before it makes one the move. Once the move is validated the input is evaluated, the input entered could be a string or an alphabet. After evaluating the input string a winner is decided by the result function and the score of the round is updated by the scorekeeper function.
